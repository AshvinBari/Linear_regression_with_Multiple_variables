# Linear_regression_with_Multiple_variables
Multiple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between a quantitative dependent variable and two or more independent variables using a straight line.

​
 =slope coefficients for each explanatory variable


ϵ=the model’s error term (also known as the residuals)
